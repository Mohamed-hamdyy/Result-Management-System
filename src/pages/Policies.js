      For details on our refund and cancellation policies, please refer to the information below. Please note that our policies may differ between offerings, and payment options may vary. Please also note that we treat violations of our Terms of Use and Honor Code very seriously, and we have no obligation to offer refunds to users who violate these or other Coursera policies, even if their requests are made within the designated refund period. Similarly, we have no obligation to offer late refunds to users who do not receive a passing mark in a Content Offering, or who are otherwise unsatisfied with their final grade.

      For more information about our refund process, including instructions for requesting a refund, please visit our Learner Help Center.

      1. One-time Purchases
      General Refunds
      Guided Projects
      Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made for guided projects.

      Courses and Specializations
      If you cancel your one-time, paid enrollment for a course or specialization, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you earn a course certificate for any course in the specialization, whichever is earlier.

      If you pre-enroll and pay for a course or specialization, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the course or specialization launches or until you have earned your course or specialization certificate, whichever is earlier.

      Refunds for Certificates
      Guided Projects
      If you do not earn your completion certificate within 180 days after registering for a guided project, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the guided project in order to complete the guided project and earn your completion certificate.

      Courses
      Once you have earned a course certificate with your payment, you are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 14 days. If you do not earn your course certificate within 180 days, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the course.

      Specializations
      Unless otherwise indicated as part of the sign-up process, you have one year after you purchase a specialization to complete the specialization.

      2. Month-to-Month Specialization Subscriptions
      General Refunds
      Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made on a month-to-month specialization subscription plan.

      Refunds for Trials
      To avoid being charged during a free trial period, you must cancel your subscription before your free trial ends. If you complete a course during the free trial period, Coursera reserves the right to require you to pay for a one-month subscription in order to receive a course and/or specialization certificate.

      Cancellation
      Your subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis unless and until you cancel or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera. If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current monthly period. You will continue to have access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund. For subscriptions to individual specializations, Coursera will automatically discontinue your subscription at the end of the monthly period during which you earn a certificate for the specialization.

      3. Coursera Plus
      General Refunds
      To get a full refund of your Coursera Plus subscription payment, submit a refund request via the Learner Help Center within 14 days of your payment. Refunds will not be provided if requested after this 14-day period.

      Refunds for Trials
      Some Coursera Plus subscriptions may have a free trial period instead of a refund period. If you do not cancel during the free trial, you will be billed the full amount for the subscription you signed up for and be unable to request a refund.

      Cancellation
      Your Coursera Plus subscription will continue for the subscription period identified at the time of your purchase and then automatically renew unless and until you cancel your subscription or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera. If you cancel your subscription after the refund period of your subscription, you will continue to have access until the end of the subscription period and will not be billed for the next billing cycle
